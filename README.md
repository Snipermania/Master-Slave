#CAN technology

Using master slave configuration a traffic managing network is established. 
STM32 board acts as master
Microcontroller 8051 is used as slave configured with IR sensors to sense vehicles on nodes and junctions across the area.
All node or junction data is centralised and processed at STM board to vary the signal timings according to fused data produced.
